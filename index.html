agenda of what the meeting will cover
things that were unfinished business from last meeting
things that are new business that need to be talked about
any miscellaneous comments / questions / concerns that anyone would like to bring up
pictures of any diagrams / architecture / things that were presented
SWE meetings often have people diagram things on a whiteboard so we want those captured as well
For the following two, you can simply take a 30 second pretend audio recording & video recording to use, we are just trying to get you familiar with the <audio> and <video> elements. Yes, you must have both audio and video elements, and yes, you can use the audio from the video you took for the audio element, it just has to be in a separate audio file.
